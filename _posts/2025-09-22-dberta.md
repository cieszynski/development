title: "A promise-based and transactional wrapper for indexedDB"
---

[__dberta.js__](https://github.com/cieszynski/dberta.js) is a small JavaScript library that provides a promise‚Äêbased and transactional wrapper around IndexedDB. It aims to make working with IndexedDB easier by offering higher-level abstractions: open databases, read and write with transactions, query/filter capabilities, etc.

#### Key features
1.  Database opening / schema definition

    You define a versioned schema when opening the database the first time.
2.  Transactional writes & reads

    You can perform write transactions (single or multiple object stores) and commit or abort them. Similarly, reads are done inside transactions (important if you write data based on reads).
3.  Query capabilities

    Methods like `.getAll()`, `.where()`, `.queryAnd()`, `.queryOr()` etc., allowing filtering by properties.
4.  Update / conditional operations
    
    e.g. `.updateOr(...)` to update objects that satisfy some predicate.
5.  Promise-based API
    
    All operations return promises (or use `async`/`await`). This makes the API more ergonomic compared to raw IndexedDB with its event-based callbacks.
